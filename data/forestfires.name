   In the above reference, the output "area" was first transformed with a ln(x+1) function.
   Then, several Data Mining methods were applied. After fitting the models, the outputs were
   post-processed with the inverse of the ln(x+1) transform. Four different input setups were
   used. The experiments were conducted using a 10-fold (cross-validation) x 30 runs. Two
   regression metrics were measured: MAD and RMSE. A Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) fed
   with only 4 direct weather conditions (temp, RH, wind and rain) obtained the best MAD value:
   12.71 +- 0.01 (mean and confidence interval within 95% using a t-student distribution). The
   best RMSE was attained by the naive mean predictor. An analysis to the regression error curve
   (REC) shows that the SVM model predicts more examples within a lower admitted error. In effect,
   the SVM model predicts better small fires, which are the majority. 
 
4. Relevant Information:

   This is a very difficult regression task. It can be used to test regression methods. Also,
   it could be used to test outlier detection methods, since it is not clear how many outliers
   are there. Yet, the number of examples of fires with a large burned area is very small.

5. Number of Instances: 517 

6. Number of Attributes: 12 + output attribute
  
   Note: several of the attributes may be correlated, thus it makes sense to apply some sort of
   feature selection.

   1. X - x-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9
   2. Y - y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9
   3. month - month of the year: "jan" to "dec" 
   4. day - day of the week: "mon" to "sun"
   5. FFMC - FFMC index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20
      The Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) represents fuel moisture of forest litter fuels under the shade of a           forest canopy. It is intended to represent moisture conditions for shaded litter fuels, the equivalent of 16       -hour timelag. It ranges from 0-101. Subtracting the FFMC value from 100 can provide an estimate for the          equivalent (approximately 10h) fuel moisture content, most accurate when FFMC values are roughly above 80.
   6. DMC - DMC index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3
      The Duff Moisture Code (DMC) represents fuel moisture of decomposed organic material underneath the litter.       System designers suggest that it is represents moisture conditions for the equivalent of 15-day (or 360 hr)       timelag fuels. It is unitless and open ended. It may provide insight to live fuel moisture stress.
   7. DC - DC index from the FWI system: 7.9 to 860.6 
      The Drought Code (DC), much like the Keetch-Byrum Drought Index, represents drying deep into the soil. It         approximates moisture conditions for the equivalent of 53-day (1272 hour) timelag fuels. It is unitless,          with a maximum value of 1000. Extreme drought conditions have produced DC values near 800.
   8. ISI - ISI index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10
      The Initial Spread Index (ISI) is analogous to the NFDRS Spread Component (SC). It integrates fuel moisture       for fine dead fuels and surface windspeed to estimate a spread potential. ISI is a key input for fire             behavior predictions in the FBP system. It is unitless and open ended.
   9. temp - temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30
   10. RH - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100
   11. wind - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40 
   12. rain - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4 
   13. area - the burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84 
   (this output variable is very skewed towards 0.0, thus it may make
    sense to model with the logarithm transform). 

8. Missing Attribute Values: None
