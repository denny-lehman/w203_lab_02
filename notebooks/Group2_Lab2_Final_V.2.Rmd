# Focused Analysis and Transformations 

# Analysis of Outcome Variable : area

Area is very important for our study because it is our outcome variable. We want to find out what factors cause area to burn in forest fires.
From the graph above, area seems to have a heavy left tail. We should use log transformation on area field to see if it helps improve a linear relationship with our predictor variables.

```{r EDA  Observations with area equal to 0,  echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, show_col_types = FALSE }
cat ("Total observations in the dataset: ", nrow(EDA))
cat("\nNumber of Observations where area is zero:" ,nrow(subset(EDA,area == 0)))
```
```{r EDA - Plot the histogram of the Distribution of Burnt Area,  echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, show_col_types = FALSE }
# Histogram of Non Log Transformed area
hist_of_area_dist <- EDA %>% 
ggplot() + aes(x = area) +
geom_histogram( bins=20, fill="cornsilk", color="black", alpha=0.9) +
labs(
x = "Area in hectare ", y="Occurrence",
title = '               Burnt area Distribution \n \nNon-Log Transformed',
caption = "Figure 1"
)


# Perform Log transformation
EDA$logarea <- log(EDA$area + 1)

# Histogram of Log Transformed area
hist_of_logarea_dist <- EDA %>% 
ggplot() + aes(x = logarea) +
geom_histogram( bins=20, fill="cornsilk", color="black", alpha=0.9) +
labs(
x = "Area in hectare ", y="Occurrence",
title = '\n\nLog Transformed ',
caption = "Figure 2"
)

# Plot both the histograms
plot_grid(hist_of_area_dist,hist_of_logarea_dist)

```

# Observation:
The graphs above has a very heavy right tail and log transformation helped improve the distribution to look more normal. However, it is still skewed right. 

#  Analyzing of Linear Relationship of Predictors Variables with Outcome individually 
# Compare if transformation helps

In our causal diagram we have identified four predictor variables 
1. rain - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4
2. wind - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40
3. FFMC - FFMC index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20
4. BUI - potential heat release in heavier fuels (total amount of fuel available for combustion): 0.0 to infinity

```{r plotting predictors vs log transformed outcome variable, , echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
a <- ggplot(EDA, aes(x = wind, y = log(area+1))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  ggtitle("wind vs log(area+1)")

b <- ggplot(EDA, aes(x = rain, y = log(area+1))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  ggtitle("rain vs log(area+1)")

c <- ggplot(EDA, aes(x = FFMC, y = log(area+1))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  ggtitle("FFMC vs log(area+1)")

d <- ggplot(EDA, aes(x = BUI, y = log(area+1))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  ggtitle("BUI vs log(area+1)")

grid.arrange(a, b, c, d, nrow = 2)
```
# Observation:
Rain and BUI variables have room for improvement. Will try log transforms to see if it helps improve linearity.

```{r plotting log trasnformed rain and BUI predictors vs outcome variable,echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
a <- ggplot(EDA, aes(x = rain, y = log(area+1))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  ggtitle("rain vs log(area+1)")

b <- ggplot(EDA, aes(x = log(rain+1), y = log(area+1))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  ggtitle("log(rain) vs log(area+1)")

c <- ggplot(EDA, aes(x = BUI, y = log(area+1))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  ggtitle("BUI vs log(area+1)")

d <- ggplot(EDA, aes(x = log(BUI), y = log(area+1))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  ggtitle("log(BUI) vs log(area+1)")

grid.arrange(a, b, c, d, nrow = 2)
```
## Conclusion
rain predictor did not benefit from a log transform. However, log(BUI) seems to have slightly improved linear relationship with log(area+1).

# Analysis of rain

```{r last resort in fixing rain variable, , echo = TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# all transformations failed to improve the plot of rain and log(area+1)/
# so, we will convert our rain variable to binary, is not raining (0) or is raining (1).

Prod <- Prod %>%
  mutate(
    rain_binary = case_when(
      rain > 0 ~ 1,
      rain == 0 ~ 0,
      )
  )

EDA <- EDA %>%
  mutate(
    rain_binary = case_when(
      rain > 0 ~ 1,
      rain == 0 ~ 0,
      )
  )

Wind - Log transformation makes the distribution worse
